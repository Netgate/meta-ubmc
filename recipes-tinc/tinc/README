This is a partial recipe in that it performs the fetch/patch/configure/make/make install but does so from a tarball, not the git repository.
The project README.git file requires that autoreconf if run first to generate the configure.in and autonf files but Yocto doesn't seem to like this.

Perform these steps:

1)	git clone git://tinc-vpn.org/tinc
2)	autoreconf -fsi
3)	tar czvf tinc.tar.gz tinc
4)	cp tinc.tar.gz {recipe "files" directory}
5)	bitbake tinc
